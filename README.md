# Angry Sneks

## Description
These sneks are angry! Apples make them grow, oranges make them fast and stars
make them bite better.

For two players (unless you're good at doing two things at once, I guess).

## Controls
- n -> New game
- q -> Quit
- p -> Pause
- wasd -> Control Red
- arrows -> Control Blue

## Installation
Using stack, just clone the repository and do a `stack install` in the directory.

It should be possible to use cabal too, but... you'll have to figure that out
on your own.
